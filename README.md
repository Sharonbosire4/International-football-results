INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL RESULTS

This project aims to explore and gain some insights into International football results from 1872 to 2020.
This dataset includes 41586 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2020. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches. Even though football emerged 148 years ago, 71% of all matches took place within the last 34 years and only 6% of all matches took place within the first 85 years (1872-1957).
The matches are strictly men's full internationals.

The dataset consists of the following columns.

Date - date of the match.
Home team - the name of the home team.
Away team - the name of the away team.
Home score - full-time home team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts.
Away score - full-time away team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts.
Tournament - the name of the tournament.
City - the name of the city/town/administrative unit where the match was played.
Country - the name of the country where the match was played.
Neutral - TRUE/FALSE column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral venue.

Objective

Some directions to take when exploring the data:
Which team played most matches?
Best team of all time.
Which teams dominated different eras of football?
What trends have there been in international football throughout the years.
Team, which scored most goals.
Number of matches per each tournament.
How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in the tournament?
Which teams are the most active in playing friendly and friendly tournaments - does it help or hurt them.
Performance of the teams both when home and away.
Hypothesis 
Is score performance affected depending on if the game takes place at home or away from home?
Methodology
The project was carried out in a Jupyter notebook, with the python codes and using various python libraries e.g. pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to extract meaningful information from the data as well as adding additional features. Techniques applied is.

Exploratory data analysis.

Findings/insights from graph

Out of 41,586 about 17,029 were Friendly matches, which is roughly 40%, followed by FIFA World Cup qualification with 7236.
England scored the most goals with 2208 in official international matches, and then came Brazil with 2149.
Brazil won most games.
Sweden played most matches. 
Popularity of soccer increased gradually over time, having peaked in 2008 with 1091 matches then followed by England then Brazil.
Sweden tops the list with 1018 matches followed by England with 1009, then Brazil, Argentina and other teams.
Away teams have scored zero goals in more than 14000 matches.	Home teams have scored one goal in maximum number of matches.

Recommendation
Drawing insights from the provided data and our established hypothesis, I concluded that match fixtures on home and away have an impact on scores of the teams. This can be due to varying reasons, including but not limited to familiarity with pitch and morale drawn from the base, hence I will recommend that more matches should be played on neutral grounds to promote fair advantage to both teams.

Conclusion

International Football results from 1872 to 2020 includes a wide range of matches and dataset. However, my focus is centered on the impact of home and away matches with reference to scores on the teams. In the course of my findings, I discovered that away scores was less than home scores while there were few neutral matches. Hence,I am of the view that teams play better during home matches and in order to grant equal advantage to both teams, there should be more neutral matches than home team and away team
